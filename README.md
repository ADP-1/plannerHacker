## ðŸš€ Running the Project (Current Status)

Right now, the scanner connects manually to an MCP server.  
Hereâ€™s how to run it:

Open Terminal A (server):
```bash
# start an HTTP/SSE MCP server (server-everything streamableHttp)
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything streamableHttp --port 3001
# Expect: "MCP Streamable HTTP Server listening on port 3001"
```


Open Terminal B (scanner, with your .venv active):

``` bash
python mcpsafety/scanner/scan.py --port 3001
```
```
