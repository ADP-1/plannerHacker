DEBUG You are the leader of a team and sub-teams of AI Agents.
      Your task is to coordinate the team to complete the user's request.

      Here are the members in your team:
      <team_members>
       - Agent 1:
         - ID: ce1552b4-6add-4cde-9310-074b0bb38049

          - get_user_details
      </team_members>

      <how_to_respond>
      - You can either respond directly or use the `run_member_agents` tool to run all members in your team to get a collaborative response.
      - To run the members in your team, call `run_member_agents` ONLY once. This will run all members in your team.
      - Analyze the responses from all members and evaluate whether the task has been completed.
      - If you feel the task has been completed, you can stop and respond to the user.
      </how_to_respond>

      <shared_context>
      You have access to a shared context that will be shared with all members of the team.
      Use this shared context to improve inter-agent communication and coordination.
      It is important that you update the shared context as often as possible.
      To update the shared context, use the `set_shared_context` tool.
      </shared_context>

      Your task is successful when the following criteria is met:
      <success_criteria>
      The team has done an exhaustive search and identified all vulnerabilities arising from the MCP Server(s) interactions, an example of how the attacker would use that tool, resource, prompt
      for some nefarious reason, and provided remediation steps.
      </success_criteria>
      Stop the team run when the success_criteria is met.

      <instructions>
      - You are a security auditor, looking for vulnerabilities in the MCP Server implementation.
      - The vulnerabilities should be directly based on the how the MCP Server utilizes its implemented (tools, prompts, and resources), and then you should consider how a hacker might abuse
      these tools to gain access, dump credentials, add backdoors to startup scripts, add their own ssh keys in etc.
      - Ensure that you are thinking like a hacker, with the goal of gaining access, lateral movement, getting callbacks using netcat, dumping credentials such as ssh keys, adding credentials
      like public ssh keys to authorized keys etc.
      - You are given a list of tools, prompts, and resources that are available on the MCP Server.
      - You are given a list of directories that you can access on the MCP Server.
      - For each attack show a concrete of example, like modifying bashrc, adding a public key to authorized_keys, adding a backdoor to a startup script, etc.

      *   **Resources**: A list of all resources the MCP Server interacts with (e.g., databases, APIs, external services, file systems), including access methods and credentials if applicable.

      *   **Directories**: A list of accessible directories on the MCP Server, along with their permissions.

      My capabilities are limited to searching external information sources such as DuckDuckGo, Arxiv, and Hacker News.

      To identify potential vulnerabilities, I would require the following information about the MCP Server:

      *   **Prompts**: Details of any prompts used by the MCP Server, especially those that accept user input or influence execution flow.
      *   **Resources**: A list of all resources the MCP Server interacts with (e.g., databases, APIs, external services, file systems), including access methods and credentials if applicable.
      *   **Tools**: A list of all tools implemented on the MCP Server, with their functionalities and any configurable parameters.
      *   **Directories**: A list of accessible directories on the MCP Server, along with their permissions.

      Once this information is provided, I can then proceed with identifying potential vulnerabilities, providing command-line examples for exploitation, remediation commands, and source
      citations for each.

prompt to ChatGpt :

Just to clarify—regarding what you shared earlier, I haven’t implemented all of it. The only change I made was setting the Gemini API key. Initially, I used a free key from Ollama, but then I created
my own API key through Gemini AI Studio, since I have Google One access. I updated the environment variable with my new key. I've attached the output here—does this mean we’re all set, or is there
still more we need to do?
